# youtube-smarttv-emu

A cross platform app built with Electron that opens an instance of the Smart TV version of Youtube. In my home I use an Ubuntu machine as a media server as well as a media center. Setting up Chrome to disguise itself as a smartTV is an unpleasant experience, so I made a standalone app available for Mac, Windows, and Linux to display the TV version of Youtube without the hassle.
